In 2014, scientists experimented "supercritical" water, 
<br>a state of water that occurs when it is compressed to a pressure of 217
<br>atmospheres and heated above 373 degrees Celsius. When mixed with organic material
<br> it creates a liquid-like gas that creates a burning effect, though with no flame.
<br>Astronauts often use supercritical water as a means to dispose of waste.
